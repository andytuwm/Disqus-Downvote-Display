Disqus Downvote Display
===

See the amount of downvotes that a comment on the Disqus platform has.

Disqus removed the ability for users to see the amount of downvotes a comment has some time in Spring 2014, however, the information is still stored inside the HTML, allowing plugins to grab it out and display it.
